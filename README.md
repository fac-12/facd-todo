Fatimat, Alexis, Caroline &amp; Dragomir week 2 project :thumbsup:

Our project this week is to create a to-do list that meets the following user stories. :memo: 

As a disorganised person I want to:

* enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
* view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
* mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
* the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb

As a disorganised person I want to:

* edit my to-dos so that I can amend them if the task changes
* click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier for me to check to-dos off
* a visual indication of which to-do I'm about to interact with so that it's clear what I'm editing

We are expected to create pure functions and use TDD for testing.
